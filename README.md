# AssetComposerBundle

A Symfony bundle to help you manage your assets directly from the `vendor` directory, ensuring all files are always up-to-date using their filetime version.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.0 or higher
- Symfony Framework Bundle 6.0 or higher

## Installation

To install AssetComposerBundle, you need to use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Run the following command in your project root:

```bash
composer require jbsnewmedia/asset-composer-bundle
```

## Usage

This bundle allows you to include assets from the `vendor` directory in your Symfony project. It ensures that all files are always current by using their last modified time as a version number. This way, you can be sure that the assets are always up-to-date, even if you update your dependencies.

### Adding Assets example 

To add assets from the `vendor` directory to your project, simply use Composer to manage your dependencies. This method ensures that all assets are always up-to-date, as Composer will handle the downloading and updating of the required packages for you. Here’s how you can include assets in your Symfony project:

**Install the asset packages via Composer**:

For example, to include Bootstrap, FontAwesome, and AvalynxAlert in your project, run the following commands:

```bash
composer require twbs/bootstrap
composer require components/font-awesome
composer require avalynx/avalynx-alert
```

This will download the asset packages into the `vendor` directory of your Symfony project.

**Include assets in your twig templates**:

Once the assets are installed, you can include them in your twig templates using the `addAssetComposer` function. This function registers the assets for inclusion in the HTML output. Here is an example of how to use it in your base template:

```twig
{% extends 'base.html.twig' %}

{% do addAssetComposer('twbs/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css') %}
{% do addAssetComposer('components/font-awesome/css/all.css') %}
{% do addAssetComposer('avalynx/avalynx-alert/dist/css/avalynx-alert.css') %}
{% do addAssetComposer('avalynx/avalynx-alert/dist/js/avalynx-alert.js') %}
```

In the example above, the CSS and JS files from the specified packages are added to the asset pipeline, ensuring they are included in the final HTML output.

**Render the assets**:

Finally, you need to render the stylesheets and javaScripts in your HTML. This can be done using the `renderAssetComposerStylesheets` and `renderAssetComposerJavascripts` functions. Here’s how to include them in your HTML structure:

```twig
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
   <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8">
       <title>{% block title %}Welcome!{% endblock %}</title>
       <link rel="icon" href="data:image/svg+xml,<svg xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22 viewBox=%220 0 128 128%22><text y=%221.2em%22 font-size=%2296%22>⚫️</text><text y=%221.3em%22 x=%220.2em%22 font-size=%2276%22 fill=%22%23fff%22>sf</text></svg>">
       {% block stylesheets %}
           {{ renderAssetComposerStylesheets() }}
       {% endblock %}

       {% block javascripts %}
           {{ renderAssetComposerJavascripts() }}
       {% endblock %}
   </head>
   <body>
       {% block body %}{% endblock %}

       {{ renderAssetComposerJavascripts('bottom') }}
   </body>
</html>
```

By following these steps, you can seamlessly manage and include assets from the `vendor` directory in your Symfony project, ensuring they are always up-to-date.
