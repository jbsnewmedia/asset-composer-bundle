# AssetComposerBundle

**AssetComposerBundle** is a Symfony bundle that helps you manage and serve assets directly from the `vendor` directory. It ensures all files are kept up-to-date by leveraging file modification timestamps for cache busting.

## 🚀 Features

- Manage CSS/JS assets via Composer packages
- Automatic versioning using file timestamps
- Simple integration with Twig templates
- Supports production/dev-only assets via `assetcomposer.json`
- Symfony 6 & 7 compatible

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher
- Symfony Framework 6.4 or 7.0

---

## 📦 Installation

Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install the bundle:

```bash
composer require jbsnewmedia/asset-composer-bundle
````

---

## 📋 Usage

### 1. Install Asset Packages via Composer

```bash
composer require twbs/bootstrap
composer require components/font-awesome
composer require avalynx/avalynx-alert
```

### 2. Register Assets in Twig Templates

```twig
{% do addAssetComposer('twbs/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css') %}
{% do addAssetComposer('components/font-awesome/css/all.css') %}
{% do addAssetComposer('avalynx/avalynx-alert/dist/css/avalynx-alert.css') %}
{% do addAssetComposer('avalynx/avalynx-alert/dist/js/avalynx-alert.js') %}
```

### 3. Render in Layout

```twig
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    {% block stylesheets %}
        {{ renderAssetComposerStylesheets() }}
    {% endblock %}
</head>
<body>
    {% block body %}{% endblock %}
    
    {% block javascripts %}
        {{ renderAssetComposerJavascripts() }}
    {% endblock %}
    
    {{ renderAssetComposerJavascripts('bottom') }}
</body>
</html>
```

    "dist/js/scripts.js"
  ],
  "files-dev": [
    "src/css/dev-styles.css",
    "src/js/dev-scripts.js"
  ]
}
```
